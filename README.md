# uptime-splash
makes users agree to EULA prior to uptime login

To install simply unpack the zip into the main uptime program folder. You may wish to backup your index.php first. The code in the new index.php simply checks for the existance of the file eula.html and if it exists, enables the logon splash screen and presents the contents of eula.txt. There is also a stylesheet included. There are no uptime settings that need to be made and no restarts of any services required. Users may edit the style to suit their needs but it currently compements uptime's style. This mod has been tested against uptime 7.8 -> 7.8.3 and should be included in the latest 7.8.3 release as well.
